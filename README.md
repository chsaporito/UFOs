# UFOs

### Overview of the analysis:
- This project is an attempt to add search functionality to the UFO Sightings website so that Ufologists and scientific researchers can have a better chance at identifying alien spaceships. In addition to The History Channel, the hundreds of documentaries, and the thousands of YouTube videos, this endeavor will provide a real research tool for anyone not swayed by the anti-alien activists and the government coverup.

### Results:
- To use this tool, researchers can simply fill in any of the five filter fields on the UFO website and immediately see the results.  The five search fields are Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. As shown below, filling in the shape field with "triangle" will filter the dataset and show all the triangle shaped craft.

- Entering a state, will show how many visitors that state has had.

- If you know the name of a city, you may enter that in the city field to show how many visitors that particular city has had.

- Real research comes into play when all the fields are filled in.

### Summary:
- One drawback of this site is that you must type in the exact name of the city, state, country, shape fill in the correct date format. Misspellings and typos will be counterproductive to doing real research.  This is exactly what the anti-alien community wants.
- Recommendations
  - Adding dropdown lists to the filter fields as well as a date picker for the date filter to prevent misspellings, typos, and formatting issues. Additionally, there should be a standard data entry form that enforces data integrity as well.
  - Scrolling through the many factual events on this website can be cumbersome as the data is not in any order.  To solve this, adding  sorting functionality to the data will save time and make research much easier.
